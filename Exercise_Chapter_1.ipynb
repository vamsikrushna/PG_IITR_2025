    "## Topic: Calculate Interest\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "When someone deposits or borrows money, the amount often grows over time due to interest. There are two common types of interest: Simple Interest and Compound Interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we'll focus on Simple Interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal (P): The original amount of money deposited or borrowed.\n",
    "Rate of Interest (R): The percentage charged or earned on the principal each year.\n",
    "Time (T): The number of years the money is deposited or borrowed for.\n",
    "The formula to calculate Simple Interest is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Interest = (Principal √ó Rate √ó Time) / 100\n",
    "This gives us the amount of money earned or paid as interest after the given time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem Statement:\n",
    "Write a function named calculate_interest that takes the following three arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "principal (amount of money deposited or borrowed),\n",
    "rate (rate of interest per year, as a percentage),\n",
    "time (duration in years),\n",
    "and returns the simple interest calculated using the formula above.\n",

    "Topic: Find First Derivative of a Function\n",
    "Simple Explanation:\n",
    "In mathematics, the derivative of a function tells us how fast the function's value is changing at a particular point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like this: if you‚Äôre driving a car and your distance changes every second, then your speed is the derivative of your distance. Similarly, for any function, the derivative gives the rate of change.\n",
    "\n",
    "We‚Äôll use a simple numerical technique called the difference method:\n",
    "\n",
    "f‚Ä≤(x)‚âàf(x+h)‚àíf(x)h\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called the forward difference method, where h is a very small number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exercise:\n",
    "Write a function approx_derivative(func, x, h) that:\n",
    "\n",
    "Takes a function func that accepts a single argument,\n",
    "A value x where we want to find the derivative,\n",
    "And a small number h (like 0.0001),\n",
    "Returns the approximate derivative of func at x.\n",
    "Example Usage:\n",
    "def square(x):\n",
    "    return x * x\n",
    "\n",
    "def cube(x):\n",
    "    return x * x * x\n",
    "\n",
    "print(approx_derivative(square, 3, 0.0001))  # Output: Approx. 6  \n",
    "print(approx_derivative(cube, 2, 0.0001))    # Output: Approx. 12  \n",
    "Note to Learner:\n",
    "Try different values of x and different functions (like math.sin, math.exp, etc.) to see how the derivative changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to import any libraries (like math) if needed."
